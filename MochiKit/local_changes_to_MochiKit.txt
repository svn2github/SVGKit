AWH - 2/27/2006 {
    In order to get the logger working in a panel, I changed the line in 
    MochiKit/LoggingPane.js that sets the style for the div with 
    id="_MochiKit_LoggingPane".  The change substative part of the change is: 
    
    line 428:     "position: fixed"  ->  "position: static"
    
    This is on line 248 (in MochiKit v1.2) and affects this (complete) line:
    
    var style = "display: block; left: 0px; bottom: 0px; position: fixed; width: 100%; background-color: white; font: " + this.logFont;
    
    Additionally, I changed the height of the panel to 20em with these changes:
    
    line 430:      "height: 10em"  ->  "height: 20em"
    line :       "height: " + (inline ? "8em" : "100%")"  ->  "height: " + (inline ? "18em" : "100%")"
    }
