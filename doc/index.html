  <title>SVGKit Overview</title>
</head>


<body>


<h2>Overview</h2>


Each of these only relies on the previos ones, so you can pick the level of functionality you want:<br />


<br />


SVGKit.js -- A low-level JavaScript SVG library. &nbsp;Create a new SVG at runtime.
&nbsp;Load SVG data from a URL. Conveniently handle quirks of three
ways SVG can be included in browsers: object, embed, and inline. Handle
differnet browsers and different SVG engines. &nbsp;Has convenience
functions for DOM manipulation ala MochiKit. It manages the objects:
HTMLElement, SVGDocument, SVGElement. &nbsp;Basic intaractive event
handling like scroll, zoom, object select and manipulate (maybe this
should go in SVGEvent.js)<br />


<br />


SVGCanvas.js -- Impliments some of the Canvas API along with some
SVG-specific additions. Allows you to create an SVG more prodecurally
rather than building it up with DOM manipulation (one of the
disadvangages sighted by <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/%7Evladimir/xtech2006/">Vladimir Vuki&Auml;&Dagger;evi&Auml;&Dagger;</a>)
There are parts of the Canvas API that do things like "take what you've
drawn so far, treat it like a bitmap, and run the following filter on
it." &nbsp;Some of these are impossible in SVG, but will get better
with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/rendering.html">SVG1.2</a><br />


<br />


SVGPlot.js -- Eventually a full plotting suite to rival Excel, Matlab,
etc. It generates clean SVG in the browser that can be saved, sent back
to server for conversion to PDF, PS, PNG, etc. Fully interactive --
zooming, selecting data, etc. Live updates via AJAX for real-time data
like stocks or web stats. Allows multiple plots arranged on an SVG,
multiple related or unrelated axes per plot, and control of styles.
Origionaly I was going to write it in pure Canvas code so you could
have either underneath (like PlotKit), but things like text made it
impossible.<br />

(Next to each item above, show an editable code snippet and the result in SVG and PNG.)<br />


<br />


For a related but independent project, see <a href="http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/">PlotKit</a>. We seem to have started around the same time, but he has a more more production quality release.<br />


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ul>
  <li>MochiKit interpreter SVG examples</li>
  <li>Using SVGKit in your own pages -- valid XHTML and served as XHTML, thing at the top for IE, explicitly include all of MochiKit.</li>
</ul>


<h2>History</h2>


I wanted a way to do interactive web stuff for my <a href="http://brainflux.org">brainflux.org</a>
page of physics and math education. I looked into SVG and played around
with Batik a bit. Then one of my research groups implimented a full web
app using Python, TurboGears, and MochiKit. We wanted to interactively
pull data out of a web page and plot it. Also we wanted a Google Maps
type interface for stars. I started really working on this in January
2006.<br />


<h2>Things I want to do with it</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Online SVG Editor for a wiki (it would have automatic JavaScript support.) &nbsp;Some kind of rudimentary Inkscape.</li>

  <li>More interactivity --&nbsp; drag/zoom controls,&nbsp; selecting &amp; manipulation of objects...</li>

  <li>Clean up the SVG that SVGCanvas and SVGPlot generate and make them faster. &nbsp;These are sometimes at odds.</li>

  <li>Interactive math/physics educational stuff like <a href="http://mathsrv.ku-eichstaett.de/MGF/homes/grothmann/java/zirkel/doc_en/index.html">Compass &amp; Ruler</a></li>

  <li>Online interface to create and edit plots -- position ledgend, click to edit title, select colors with GUI, etc.</li>

</ul>


<h2>About Me</h2>


<h2> Requirements</h2>



<ul>


  <li>
      <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit 1.3 or higher</a></li>


  <li>
     SVG: Opera 9+, Firefox 1.5+, IE6 with Adobe SVG.
 </li>


</ul>

<h2>SVG Complaints/Outlook:</h2>


Fonts are a huge problem. The SVG spec is written so that you can embed
a font and use it so you get precise alignment and pixel-perfect
anti-aliased rendering. When you're rendering axis labels, I query the
exact dimensions of the resulting text for optimal placement.
&nbsp;None of this works (very well) in Firefox yet.<br />
