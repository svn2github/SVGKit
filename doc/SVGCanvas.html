<h2>Introduction</h2>
SVGCanvas is a JavaScript implimentation of most of the Canvas drawing
API which creates SVG grapics elements instead of drawing to a pixel
buffer. I wanted a way of scripting the creation of SVG graphics
without always explicitly managing the DOM tree. Since Canvas is
becomming a de facto web standard and the two interfaces are similar
(e.g. linear and radial gradients of the same form) I took advantage of
the API.<br />
<br />
Canvas is a pixel-based representation like a paint program.
&nbsp;You can
draw shapes over each other and they will modify the pixels.
&nbsp;SVG is
more like a drawing program where shapes are always there even if they
get covered up.<br />
<br />
Canvas is a stack-based API where you set the color and line style,
move to a spot, draw some lines, set another color, draw more lines,
etc. &nbsp;Almost all graphical libraries impliment this becuase in
many situations it's more convenient and efficient than passing the
parameters with each call. &nbsp;SVG is a tree representation where
you can group objects and apply fill color, for example, to the whole
group that get applied for every member that doens't explicitly specify
their own fill color. Some things are&nbsp; cleaner to do in one
model or the other. See <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/presentations/xtech2005/svg-canvas/">Canvas
and SVG</a> slides by Robert O'Callahan at mozilla.org for a good
overview about why the web needs both.<br />
<br />
It was easiest to get SVGPlot to efficiently generate clean SVG code
using a combination of DOM tree manipulation and Canvas calls.<br />
<br />
Why would you want this?<br />
<ul>
  <li>The Canvas API is a nice API to build up an SVG without
explicit DOM manipulations.</li>
  <li>SVG (with JavaScript) is a W3C standard, but canvas is not.</li>
  <li>When your browser supports SVG not canvas.</li>
  <li>Code written for canvas can be used&nbsp;to create an
SVG.</li>
  <li>Save the result of canvas calls to an SVG file for later
display, conversion to PDF or PNG, or printing at high-res.</li>
  <li>Can apply events to objects (shapes) rather
than&nbsp;have to translate the (x,y) coordinates like you do in
Canvas.</li>
</ul>
<br />
When wouldn't you use this?<br />
<ul>
  <li>When speed matters. With this, you just stack SVG shapes on
top of each other forever.&nbsp; Even you clear it, those others
will still be around taking memory and rendering time. For things like
games and photographic content, you want the "blast it to the screen
and forget it" model.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the simplest representation of a graphic is a
program to draw it (e.g. fractals, function plotting) rather than an
XML-like description.</li>
  <li>When your browser supports canvas but not SVG</li>
</ul>
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/">
Batik</a> impliments the Java AWT API to draw directly to SVG.
&nbsp;<a href="http://fuchsia-design.com/CanvaSVG/">CanvaSVG</a>
goes the other way, rendering SVGs onto a canvas. SVG has a richer
(more complicated) set of things like arcs, and&nbsp;<span class="attribute">stroke-dasharray</span> that are not
built into the Canvas API making it hard on them and easy on me.
&nbsp;Other things like shadows and <code>globalCompositeOperation</code>&nbsp;are
not straight forward to impliment without nateive SVG support.
&nbsp;<a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>
can render to bitmaps, PDF, PS, SVG, OpenGL, and others.&nbsp;You
can write a PostScript program to print out arbitrarily many digits of
pi, or have the printer calculate fractals. Canvas and SVG provide this level of programing using JavaScript.<br />
<h2>Background/History<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></h2>
PostScript was a vector drawing state-machine-based language, PDF is a
subset without the programming language (conditionals and loops). Canvas is a drawing API inspired by PS and PDF.
&nbsp;SVG is a scenegraph
representation. &nbsp;It's like the difference between OpenGL and
Open Inventor. &nbsp;All drawing of windows and widets
in&nbsp;NeXT was done used PostScript, and in OS X using PDF.
&nbsp;The advantage was that the same code that is drawing to the
window can be used to draw to the printer without any translation.<br />
<br />
Canvas as SVG, though simple, is quite powerful, supporting
transparency, gradients, clipping, blending, bezeir curves, and others
that Win32/GDI and QuickDraw2D, and Java's AWT did not.
&nbsp;Except for transparency, these have a PostScript history.<br />

<p>Sometimes you want direct access to the pixels. In photo
manipulation, 3D per-pixel lighting and shading, non-linear
transformations, displaying image or video, a smoke or fire effect,
filters, or interval graphing techniques. Dealing with an array of
colors is more efficient than drawing a rectangle for each pixel using
vector-graphics techniques. Some of these are addressed in the SVG
filters -- you can have your drop shadow and the advantage of SVG. The
other advantage is being able to both read and write the color array.</p>

<h2>Overview of my Canvas Implementation using SVG</h2>
There is a single object SVGCanvas which acts like Canvas's 2D context
that you get from getContext("2d"). Maybe I should have called it
SVGCanvas2dContext to keep my options open for 3D, but X3DCanvas is
probably a better route.<br />
<br />
There were some decisions to be made regarding trading off speed to
create the SVG, speed to render the SVG, generating clean factorized
SVG. &nbsp;What happens when you draw, transform, draw, transform,
draw, etc.<br />
<ul>
  <li>Should SVGCanvas keep an explicit current
transformation matrix and multiply each incomming coordinate by it and
write out the transformed coordinates? This is what the Canvas and SVG
renderers do internally. This produces ugly SVG with lots of decimal
digits that have no relation to the often simple coordinates provided.</li>
  <li>Another option would be to construct a huge string of
transformations and include them in the SVG element: <code>transform="translate(75,
75) scale(0.4, 0.4) rotate(6)"</code>
This is how you would write SVG "by hand." The problem with this is
that the transformations can get longer and longer. Another problem is
that you lineTo() rotate() lineTo() before you emit a path
with&nbsp;
fill() and there is no way specify a single transformation for the
whole path.</li>
</ul>
SVGCanvas keeps the current state and a stack of saved states. The
state includes things like the fill style and transformation, but not
the path. An SVG element is only written to the SVG when you do a <code>fill()</code>,
<code>stroke()</code> or <code>clip()</code>
or things like <code>fillRect()</code> that call one of
these.<br />
<br />
Gradients, clipping paths, markers, patterns, and other objects that
you define and use many times are created by standard Canvas methods or
a Canvas inspired SVG-only one.<br />
<h2>Overview of SVG Extensions</h2>
Since I want to be able to use this as an easy way to draw into an SVG
rather than just a pure Canvas implimentation, there are several SVG
specific features.<br />
<ul>
  <li>You can pick the SVG group you're drawing into by setting <code>drawGroup</code>.
It lives in the state. &nbsp;All elements go into this group. (They
have transformations applied to them from higher-level goups.)</li>
  <li>Actions like <code>stroke()</code> and <code>fill()</code>
return the DOM element of the path or group that was created.
&nbsp;Usually you ignore it.</li>
  <li>You can manipulate the state dictionary yourself with <code>getState</code>
and <code>setState</code>.</li>
  <li><code>applyStyles</code> is part of the state.
&nbsp;If you have
an SVG group that already has styling properties you need, you can set
this to just output the shape elements and let the styles be inherited.</li>
  <li>Every SVG element can be created directly with the current
transformation and style applied by passing appropriate arguments to,
for example, <code>strokeCircle()</code>,&nbsp;<code>fillCircle()</code>,
or <code>drawCircle()</code>.</li>
  <li> <code>text()</code> funtion that takes a
string and a position. A big shortcoming of canvas is its lack of
integrated text. &nbsp;I've also added font and textAnchor
properties to the state.</li>
  <li><code>draw()</code> action: To draw a shape
that has both a <code>fill()</code> and <code>stroke()</code>,
in Canvas you set up the path, then call <code>fill()</code>
then <code>stroke()</code>
to stroke on top of the fill. You can do that here too, but it would
generate two seperate SVG elemtns rather than a single one with both
fill and stroke properties. If you edit the SVG and drag around the
fill, the stroke won't come with it. Within <code>stroke()</code>
I can look to see if I've just done a <code>fill()</code>,
but this check is inneficient. Every time you do a stroke you have to
compare the current state and the element you're trying to fill (path,
rect, etc) with the previous thing. Maybe this is worth doing rather
than defining a whole new non-canvas-API function, but it's far easier
to add a draw function to the canvas context that calls <code>fill()</code>
then <code>stroke()</code>.</li>
</ul>
