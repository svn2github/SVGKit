<p>A collection of JavaScript libraries for painless client-side SVG
  manipulation: SVGKit provides browser-independent access and
  interaction, SVGCanvas implements Canvas API with SVG-specific
  additions, and SVGPlot plots/graphs data and functions.</p>
  <p>
  <a href="SVGKit.html"><strong>SVGKit</strong></a> -- A low-level JavaScript SVG library. Create a new SVG at runtime.
Load SVG data from a URL. Conveniently handle quirks of three
  ways SVG can be included in browsers: object, embed, and inline. Handle
  different browsers and different SVG engines. Has convenience
  functions for DOM manipulation ala MochiKit. It manages the objects:
  HTMLElement, SVGDocument, SVGElement. Basic interactive event
  handling like scroll, zoom, object select and manipulate (maybe this
  should go in SVGEvent.js)</p>
  <p>
  <a href="SVGCanvas.html"><strong>SVGCanvas</strong></a> -- Implements most of the Canvas API along with some
  SVG-specific additions. Allows you to create an SVG more prodecurally
  rather than building it up with DOM manipulation (one of the
  disadvantages sighted by <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/%7Evladimir/xtech2006/">Vladimir Vuki&#263;evi&#263;</a>)
  There are parts of the Canvas API that do things like &quot;take what you've
  drawn so far, treat it like a bitmap, and run the following filter on
  it.&quot; Some of these are impossible in SVG, but will get better
  with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/rendering.html">SVG1.2</a></p>
    <p>
<a href="SVGPlot.html"><strong>SVGPlot</strong></a> -- Eventually a full plotting suite to rival Excel, Matlab, etc. 
It generates clean SVG in the browser that can be saved, sent back to server for conversion to PDF, PS, PNG, etc. 
Fully interactive -- zooming, selecting data, etc. Live updates via AJAX for real-time data like stocks or web stats. 
Allows multiple plots arranged on an SVG, multiple related or unrelated axes per plot, and control of styles. 
Originally I was going to write it in pure Canvas code so you could have either underneath (like PlotKit), but 
things like text made it impossible. For a related but independent project, see 
<a href="http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/">PlotKit</a>. We seem to have started around the same time, 
but he has a more more production quality release. </p>
<p>
  (Next to each item above, show an editable code snippet and the result in SVG and PNG.)</p>
  <p>
  It's annoying to have external javascript files, especially a big
  library like MochiKit and SVGKit, but for anything more than a simple
  demo, it's worth it. You can also pick which functions you want
  to include and paste them into your SVG.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Play with some of the examples online with the MochiKit interpreter SVG examples</li>
  <li>Download a release or use subversion to check out the most recent version.</li>
  <li>Using SVGKit in your own pages -- valid XHTML and served as XHTML, thing at the top for IE, explicitly include all of MochiKit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>I wanted a way to do interactive web stuff for my <a href="http://brainflux.org">brainflux.org</a>
page of physics and math education. I looked into SVG and played around
with Batik a bit. Then one of my research groups implemented a full web
app using Python, TurboGears, and MochiKit. We wanted to interactively
pull data out of a web page and plot it. Also we wanted a Google Maps
type interface for stars. I started really working on this in January
2006.</p>
<h2>Things I want to do with it</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SVGWidgets -- Buttons, sliders, textboxes, etc. </li>
  <li>SVGDraw -- Online SVG Editor for a wiki (it would have automatic JavaScript support.) Some kind of rudimentary <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>.</li>
  <li>More interactivity -- drag/zoom controls, selecting &amp; manipulation of objects...</li>
  <li>Clean up the SVG that SVGCanvas and SVGPlot generate and make
the code run faster. These are sometimes at odds. For example,
should it spend time factoring out common styles to an enclosing group?</li>
  <li>Interactive math/physics educational stuff like <a href="http://mathsrv.ku-eichstaett.de/MGF/homes/grothmann/java/zirkel/doc_en/index.html">Compass &amp; Ruler</a></li>
  <li>Online interface to create and edit plots -- position legend, click to edit title, select colors with GUI, etc.</li>
  <li>Graphics are an excellent way to programing. With Canvas
(using client-side JavaScript) you can
emphasizegraphical,numerical, plotting, and gaming
applications. Have the
infrastructure to set up a textarea with a JavaScript function that
filters some array, for example, and be able to edit the code, hit the
button, and in real time see the result.</li>
  <li>Realtime plots -- stocks, web logs, ... -- add additional data points without undoing changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<h2> Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
      <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit 1.3 or higher</a></li>
  <li>
     SVG: Opera 9+, Firefox 1.5+, IE6 with Adobe SVG.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects that Use SVGKit</h2>
SVGPlot<br />
StarMap<br />
<h2>SVG Complaints/Outlook:</h2>
<p>Adobe's Plugin is way ahead of Firefox in terms of a completeness,
speed, and interface features (like zooming, viewing the SVG in its own
window, and viewing the SVG source.)</p>
<p>
Fonts are a huge problem. The SVG spec is written so that you can embed
a font and use it so you get precise alignment and pixel-perfect
anti-aliased rendering. When you're rendering axis labels, I query the
exact dimensions of the resulting text for optimal placement.
None of this works (very well) in Firefox yet.</p>
<p>
Sounds. This is more of a JavaScript problem, but I'd like to
give it .wav and .mp3 files to play, and be able to generate that raw
wav or mp3 data programatically and send it to be played (for a Fourier
synthesis program, for example.)<br />
