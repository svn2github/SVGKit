Have actual plotting happen in the plot's native coordinates and use a transform to get it where
you want it.

SVG Notes:
* Apply styles to group of objects, not each one.


SVG Functions:
* Ability to include it in SVG documents themselves
* Also reference SVG through inline, object, embed, or iframe.
* <SVGTSpanElement>.firstChild.textContent = "Blah"
* If MochiKit.SVG is included in an SVG document, svgDocument and svgElement come automatically set.
* Integrate Canvas in IE and SVG in IE code (MochiKit is maximally cross-browser where possible)
* Events -- make zoomable, dragable, rotateable with easy functions

Server:
* Parallel Python libraries for server-side stuff
* Ability to shuttle generated SVG DOM back to server for conversion to PDF
* Command-line Java Script interpreter to run same JS code natively.
* Auxiliary JS that sends rendered SVG back so page can be shown with all static (SVG or PNG) content

SVG Notes:
* Apply styles to group of objects, not each one.

Decorations on the plot:
* Axes
* Axes tick marks
* Grid
* Value Labels

Things that can be drawn on plot:
* Horizontal and Vertical lines
* Circles and other SVG shit, all automatically in plot coordinates
* Arrows on line plots when they go off the top/bottom
   -- more generally, specify what to put at the ends of the ranges (open circles, closed squares, arrows)
   -- and a few places in the middle too to give a sense of contour.  Unfortunately, not at every new path segment.
   
Static vs Dynamics:
* Simple package to render static graphs client-side
* More complicated package to provide interaction (zooming, panning, cross-hair tracing)
* Read in XML description vs totally programatic.  Can dynamically map one to the other. "Record" flag on.

Decorations off the plot:
* Title
* Axes on the side of plot
* Box around plot
* Tick marks on axes or box
* Axes Name Labels

Plots Themselves:
* Scatter plot
* Bar plot
* Line Plot
  - with and without shading to axis or to another plot
  - With or without a dot style
* Pie Chart

Misc:
* Complex Plot with rainbow gradient
* LaTeX equations to SVG using either paths or embedded font
* Widgets in canvas/SVG for sliders and such

Data Based versus Function Based
* Data Based can auto set x & y ranges
* Function based can only set y range
* Get passed in a JavaScript function for now
* Text that can be evaled
